# Digitization Toolkit

An open-source, modular digitization toolkit designed for low-cost, high-quality scanning using Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 and 64MP ArduCam cameras. Built for use in low-resource environments and community archives.

## Goals

- Empower small institutions and communities to digitize archival materials.
- Provide an easy-to-use web interface for image capture, metadata entry, and export.
- Ensure long-term reproducibility through open standards (BagIt, CSV, TIFF).
- Prioritize modularity and hardware independence for future-proofing.

## Tech Stack

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi CM4 + CM4IO, 2x 64MP ArduCam autofocus cameras
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **Frontend**: Svelte
- **Database**: SQLite

## Status

> Project currently in development. Kick-off: April 2025  
> Alpha prototype planned for deployment at SBMAL in October 2025.
